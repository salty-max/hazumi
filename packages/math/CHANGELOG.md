# @hazumi/math

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 51cf458: Declare the backend capability contract instead of probing for it.

  `Renderer` now carries `setPasses`, `setTime` and `stats` as optional members
  beside `readPixels` and `writePixels`, so a backend author can see from the
  interface what implementing each one unlocks. Previously the runtime declared
  private structural types listing members `Renderer` never mentioned and probed
  for them with `typeof`, which made the whole capability contract discoverable
  only by reading L5's source. The runtime still guards at runtime — a capability
  really is optional — but the types it narrows to are now derived from the
  interface rather than restated beside it, so they cannot drift.

  `ShaderPass` and `FrameStats` move to `@hazumi/graphics`, which owns the
  contract. Both were previously declared more than once — `ShaderPass` three
  times over, agreeing only by coincidence of shape. `hazumi` re-exports them, so
  existing imports are unaffected.

  New exports: `ShaderPassesUnavailableError` from `hazumi`, thrown where a bare
  `Error` used to be when a scene asks for shader passes on a backend without a
  shader stage; and `toByte` from `@hazumi/color`, the 0-1 to 0-255 quantisation
  the Canvas2D and SVG backends had each copied.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 6206ffb: Add pooled particles and pin the scaffold to the library version.

  `particles()` is a fixed-capacity pool. `emit` bursts, `drip` emits at a
  rate without allocating a count each frame, and `draw(alpha)` interpolates
  from the previous update. Bursts take origin ranges, inherited `vx`/`vy`,
  rotation, and spin. The default paint is additive circles, or tinted sprites
  when the system or burst has an `image` — pass `Blend.Normal` for dust.
  `create-hazumi` no longer pins `hazumi` to its own semver; the generated app
  asks for `^0.3.0`.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- d49907a: Version the runtime packages together.

  `hazumi` and `@hazumi/*` now share a version via the changesets `fixed`
  group, so a bump in one package releases the whole library at the same
  number. `create-hazumi` stays independent.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 21e6c3d: Point package homepage at the live site.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

First public release: a typed command buffer, WebGL2 as the primary renderer, Canvas2D as the pixel oracle, SVG export, and a headless recorder.

`start()` runs scenes with a fixed-step clock, capability imports (`hazumi/draw`, `hazumi/input`, `hazumi/scene`, `hazumi/assets`), a 2D camera, and typed plugins. Colour is OKLCH: `fill(oklch(0.7, 0.18, 250))` or `fill(rgb(255, 40, 20))`. CSS strings still parse.

Also in 0.1.0: SDF text, images and sprites, bezier paths, shader passes, pixel access, PNG capture, Web Audio, a rigid-body host, grid A*, a debug overlay, `create-hazumi`, and an optional Vite auto-import for `*.scene.ts` files.
